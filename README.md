# CS340 Intro to Databases
**Group Project - Renewable Energy Systems Supply**
**Liam Robbins & Arthur Tripp**

This quarter-long project is a database running on MariaDB with a website front-end. We are demonstrating CRUD functions across several tables, and managing several 1:M & M:N relationships between them.

Our application runs on javascript, including **Node.js**, **handlebars.js**, and **express**, and our vanilla code includes **AJAX**. **HTML**, **CSS**, and **SQL** are used  as well. 

This was built for Oregon State University's CS340 - Intro to Databases course. Much of this code was adapted from course materials, especially hosted at https://github.com/osu-cs340-ecampus/nodejs-starter-app. We also made use of the wonderful time-saving tool at https://tablesgenerator.com/ to construct to bones of our tables.
