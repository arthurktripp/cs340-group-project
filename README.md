CS340 Intro to Databases
Group Project - Renewable Energy Systems Supply
Liam Robbins & Arthur Tripp

This quarter-long project is a database running on MariaDB with a website front-end. We are demonstrating CRUD functions across several tables, and managing 1:M & M:N relationships between them.

We'll be using MySQL, HTML, CSS, Javascript (including Vanilla, Node.js and Handlebars).
